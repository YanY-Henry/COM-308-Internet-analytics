# COM-308: Internet analytics, 2024 Spring EPFL

The class seeks a balance between foundational but relatively basic material in algorithms, statistics, graph theory and related fields, with real-world applications inspired by the current practice of internet and cloud services.  
Specifically, we look at social & information networks, recommender systems, clustering and community detection, search/retrieval/topic models, dimensionality reduction, stream computing, and online ad auctions. Together, these provide a good coverage of the main uses for data mining and analytics applications in social networking, e-commerce, social media, etc.  
The course is combination of theoretical materials and weekly laboratory sessions, where we explore several large-scale datasets from the real world. For this, you will work with a dedicated infrastructure based on Hadoop & Apache Spark.
